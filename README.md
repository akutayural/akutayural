# 👋 Hi, I'm Kutay

I'm a **Python Software Engineer** based in London, UK, with a strong focus on building scalable, high-performance systems. I specialize in FinTech applications, diving deep into the intricacies of payment processing, cryptocurrency platforms, and e-wallet solutions. Alongside my backend expertise, I hold an MSc in Data Science and have a keen interest in machine learning and predictive analytics.

### 📢 New Library Release!

Check out my latest library, **[APIException](https://github.com/akutayural/APIException)**! 🎉 It’s a fully customizable exception-handling toolkit for FastAPI, designed to standardize error codes, messages, and HTTP status responses. Perfect for anyone wanting centralized control over error handling from the backend.

**APIException** includes:
- Extensible error codes
- Detailed logging
- Seamless integration with FastAPI

It makes handling exceptions and managing responses a breeze. Give it a try on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/APIException/) and let me know what you think! 😊

### 🌱 What I’m Currently Exploring
- **Advanced Backend Architectures**: Delving into microservices and distributed systems to build even more scalable, resilient applications.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Experimenting with high-frequency, real-time data processing to improve transaction speed and user experience in FinTech.
- **Enhanced Application Security**: Studying techniques in data encryption, threat detection, and robust authentication protocols to safeguard applications and user data.
