# 👋 Hi, I'm Kutay

I'm a **Python Software Engineer** based in London, UK, with a strong focus on building scalable, high-performance systems. I specialise in FinTech applications, diving deep into the intricacies of payment processing, cryptocurrency platforms, and e-wallet solutions. Alongside my backend expertise, I hold an MSc in Data Science and have a keen interest in machine learning and predictive analytics.
